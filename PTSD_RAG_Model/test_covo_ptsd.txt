an anxiety disorder that is associated with nonanxiety symptoms.1 According to such models, anxiety and
fear consist of cognitive (e.g., fearful thoughts), behavioral (e.g., avoidance behaviors), and physiological 
features (e.g., autonomic arousal; see Figure 2.1). Each factor influences the others. For example, Susan 
is afraid of heights. When she starts to climb a ladder to change a light bulb in a chandelier hanging from 
a vaulted ceiling, she experiences fearful thoughts (e.g., ªClimbing this ladder is dangerous; I could fall 
and break my neckº), physiological arousal (e.g., pounding heart, rapid breathing, trembling), and 
avoidance behaviors (e.g., getting off the ladder after climbing only two rungs and asking someone else to
do the task for her). Thus, changing fearful thoughts about a situation (e.g., ªI've seen Karen do this a 
million times without any problems; the ladder is strong and very stable; I can do this even though I feel

she was obligated to take care of her father in old age. As a result, Gloria decreased contact with her 
father, and her urges to cut also rapidly declined. Similarly, Nihla, who was sexually abused by her 
cousin, continued to have regular contact with him at family functions and via telephone, even though he 
was often subtly sexually suggestive during these encounters. These contacts fueled Nihla's an- ger, so 
her therapist began by addressing Nihla's thoughts that she was obligated to maintain a relationship with 
her cousin. Subsequent interventions also targeted an- ger. 
Finally, the decision to introduce cognitive restructuring first also relates to practi- cal issues of timing. If 
you are beginning treatment with a new patient right before you leave for vacation, then this might not be 
a good time to start exposure. Thus, you might decide to introduce cognitive restructuring during the few

(e.g., behaviors, thoughts, and sensations), and meanings/interpretations of the event. Fear networks can
be thought of as programs we use to promote survival when faced with life-threatening danger. 
When fear networks incorrectly link stimuli or contain flawed assumptions, the in- dividual fears safe 
situations and objects. For example, cognitive models suggest that when encoding and storing the 
experience of being raped, Elizabeth associated wall clocks with danger. Thus, wall clocks activate her 
fear network, which contains the emotional experience of fear (including heightened arousal) and 
memories of the rape, as well as interpretations of the world (e.g., ªAll men are dangerousº). Elizabeth 
also experiences the urge to avoid both memories and the actual stimuli (wall clocks). In addition, 
because associations formed during dangerous situations are particularly strong, wall clocks now activate

because associations formed during dangerous situations are particularly strong, wall clocks now activate
the fear network rather than previous, positive experi- ences with wall clocks. Yet wall clocks are not in 
themselves dangerous, nor are they ac- curate signals of danger. 
Maladaptive conclusions (e.g., that wall clocks predict danger) result when trau- ma survivors trauma 
survivors interrupt processing before they incorporate correc- tive information that would allow them to 
draw more helpful conclusions. Two con- ditions are necessary to complete processing and reduce 
unhelpful fears (Foa et al., 1989). First, the fear network must be activated; that is, the individual must 
experi- ence fear elicited by trauma cues and memories. Second, corrective information must be available
at the same time to promote new learning. For example, Elizabeth avoided her fear by avoiding wall

extreme nature of some traumatic events can disrupt memory and attention, and thereby impede 
processing of the event (Foa & Rothbaum, 1998; Foa et al., 1989). For example, during a mugging at 
gunpoint, Susan was only vaguely aware of what was happening to her boyfriend, because she was 
unable to pull her at- tention away from the gun pointed at her. Thus, she had difficulty making sense of 
the entire mugging event, which involved her boyfriend being extensively beaten. In our experience, this 
type of difficulty may be particularly true for childhood abuse survi- vors, possibly because children do not 
have fully developed cognitive abilities. 
In addition, because traumatic events are typically characterized by a lack of pre- dictability and control, 
individuals who hold beliefs about the importance of being able to predict and control events in their lives 
face an inherently challenging cognitive task when the traumatic event strongly contradicts these beliefs.
--------------------------------
there are three main cognitive solutions to this conflict. First, Elizabeth may alter her interpretation of the 
experience to fit with her belief sys- tem (e.g., ªI made him want to rape me by wearing sexy clothes, 
because I thought he was good looking; women don't get randomly raped in their own house by friendsº 
or ªIt wasn't really a rape, because I liked him and let him do itº). Second, Elizabeth might radically alter 
her belief system in a maladaptive way (e.g., ªNo place is safe anymore; I will never be safeº). Third, she 
might alter, or accommodate, her belief system in a more moderate, productive manner (ªAlthough I liked 
him, I didn't ask him to rape me. Some men are dangerous, but many are not. I am still mostly safe as 
long as I am reasonably carefulº). PTSD is associated with the first two cognitive solutions.

her emo- tional reaction (fear) to the intrusive memories (rather than her reaction to the assault itself) was
her greatest source of distress and led to increased efforts to avoid the mem- ories. 
Such secondary emotional reactions also can involve feelings of shame (e.g., ªThe fact that I can't get 
over it means I'm weakº), hopelessness (e.g., ªThe fact that I'm still having these intrusive thoughts after

common reason to start with cognitive restructuring is if your assessment indicates that your patient is 
experiencing strong feelings of guilt and/or shame in relation to the traumatic event. These feelings might 
impede willing- ness to engage in exposure, or they might interfere with habituation during exposure and 
result in diminished benefit for your patient (discussed in greater detail later in Chapter 8). 
If you plan to include exposure and cognitive restructuring simultaneously throughout treatment, it also 
may make sense to initiate cognitive restructuring first, because thoughts that emerge during exposure 
sometimes are not addressed by expo- sure alone. In such cases, you use cognitive restructuring to

Nonanxiety-related emotions such as anger, guilt, and shame play a prominent role in many cases of 
PTSD. In some cases, nonanxiety emotions such as shame and anger, along with related beliefs, 
influence the degree to which trauma survivors are willing or able to process the event either through 
verbal disclosure or by mental review. For example, many people in our society are uncomfortable with 
the topic of rape, making it difficult for many rape survivors to talk about their experiences. In addition, 
survi- vors often want to protect family and friends from the details of their experiences. For example, 
Adele reported that after being raped, she did not tell her family what had happened, because she did not 
want them to realize that she was now ªdamaged.º She also noted that when she finally told her best 
friend, she left out most of the details: ªWhat was I going to say? You don't talk about the blow-by-blow 
details of being raped. You just don't.º

For example, Evelyn be- lieved that ªeveryone makes choices and is in control of what happens to themº 
and that ªwhen bad things happen to you, it is because you made bad choices.º As a result, she 
experienced significant shame about being raped by a stranger and blamed herself, even though there 
was little evidence that she could have prevented the event. Evelyn had difficulty reconciling her prior 
beliefs and evidence that the rape was not her fault.

posttrauma learned alarms, however, usually fade over time. 
Because traumatic events, in addition to fear, can also evoke intense emotions such as shame and guilt, 
these emotions may also be elicited by the same stimuli that pro- duce learned alarms (Keane & Barlow, 
2002). For example, Elizabeth reported that feel- ings of shame usually accompanied fear when she was 
exposed to wall clocks. In some cases, these emotions may be the predominant learned experience when
individuals encounter stimuli that remind them of the traumatic event.2 Regardless, because all of these

vors develop anxiety (i.e., ªanxious apprehensionº) about encountering triggers and the emotional 
responses associated with them. This anxiety motivates trauma survi- vors to avoid trauma-related 
stimuli, and they may also seek to avoid their emotions al- together via emotional numbing. 
Interestingly, Keane and Barlow (2002) argue that development of PTSD is not yet a fait accompli. 
Rather, whether the initial learned alarms become a persistent problem and snowball into full-blown 
PTSD depends on the trauma survivor's coping style and resources, and the accessibility of social 
support. For example, after returning from Af- ghanistan, Paul realized that no one wanted to hear about 
the horrible things he wit- nessed during combat. Rather, they wanted him to ªjust put it behind him.º 
Thus, he adopted a coping strategy of avoiding thoughts about Afghanistan and situations that reminded
--------------------------------
When the brain detects threat, it directs the body to release adrenaline, which immediately produces 
involuntary changes in physical functions that enable short-term survival ac- tivities. Many of the 
sensations reported by individuals experiencing a fight±flight re- sponse, such as dry mouth and 
queasiness, occur because long-term survival needs, such as digestion of food, are put on hold. Other 
symptoms, such as dizziness, are thought to be secondary effects caused by a lack of physical exertion. 
In other words, because there is no lion, the individual does not fight or flee. This produces a cascade of 
secondary effects (e.g., overoxygenated blood results in constriction of blood vessels in the brain) that 
result in additional symptoms (e.g., feeling lightheaded). 
Keane and Barlow (2002) suggest that during the traumatic event, individuals as- sociate a variety of 
stimuli (e.g., as in Elizabeth's case, the wall clock) with the experi- ence of a ªtrue alarmº and as a result

In Elizabeth's case, the new evidence led her to conclude that ªno place is safe.º Because it is extremely 
important for our survival to avoid danger, we, like Elizabeth, may be prone to err on the side of safety 
and assume danger even where none exists. Resick and Schnicke (1992) refer to conclusions such as 
ªno place is safeº as ªstuck points.º Stuck points are trauma-related thoughts that contribute to negative 
posttrau- matic reactions. In addition to focusing on danger, stuck points may focus on issues such as 
lack of trust, guilt, or other negative emotional reactions. Stuck points are often associated with 
reconciling previous beliefs and the traumatic event. As in Elizabeth's case they also may arise as a result
of blaming comments by people she expected to be supportive (e.g., ªWhy did you tempt him by dressing

It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of "what ifs" and "if onlys". It's understandable that you would think that if you hadn't gone out for ice cream, the assault wouldn't have happened. But it's important to recognize that you were just a child and didn't have the capacity to anticipate or prevent what happened. The responsibility for what happened lies with the perpetrators, not with you.

That's a great start! Recognizing that it's not your fault is an important step. Now, let's try to reframe that thought in a more realistic and compassionate way. Instead of "If I hadn't gone out for ice cream, this wouldn't have happened," what if we say "I was a child who was victimized by criminals, and it's not my fault that they chose to hurt me"? How does that feel?

there are three main cognitive solutions to this conflict. First, Elizabeth may alter her interpretation of the 
experience to fit with her belief sys- tem (e.g., ªI made him want to rape me by wearing sexy clothes, 
because I thought he was good looking; women don't get randomly raped in their own house by friendsº 
or ªIt wasn't really a rape, because I liked him and let him do itº). Second, Elizabeth might radically alter 
her belief system in a maladaptive way (e.g., ªNo place is safe anymore; I will never be safeº). Third, she 
might alter, or accommodate, her belief system in a more moderate, productive manner (ªAlthough I liked 
him, I didn't ask him to rape me. Some men are dangerous, but many are not. I am still mostly safe as 
long as I am reasonably carefulº). PTSD is associated with the first two cognitive solutions.

common reason to start with cognitive restructuring is if your assessment indicates that your patient is 
experiencing strong feelings of guilt and/or shame in relation to the traumatic event. These feelings might 
impede willing- ness to engage in exposure, or they might interfere with habituation during exposure and 
result in diminished benefit for your patient (discussed in greater detail later in Chapter 8). 
If you plan to include exposure and cognitive restructuring simultaneously throughout treatment, it also 
may make sense to initiate cognitive restructuring first, because thoughts that emerge during exposure 
sometimes are not addressed by expo- sure alone. In such cases, you use cognitive restructuring to 
address these thoughts im- mediately following an exposure, if your patient has already learned the skill.

extreme nature of some traumatic events can disrupt memory and attention, and thereby impede 
processing of the event (Foa & Rothbaum, 1998; Foa et al., 1989). For example, during a mugging at 
gunpoint, Susan was only vaguely aware of what was happening to her boyfriend, because she was 
unable to pull her at- tention away from the gun pointed at her. Thus, she had difficulty making sense of 
the entire mugging event, which involved her boyfriend being extensively beaten. In our experience, this 
type of difficulty may be particularly true for childhood abuse survi- vors, possibly because children do not 
have fully developed cognitive abilities. 
In addition, because traumatic events are typically characterized by a lack of pre- dictability and control, 
individuals who hold beliefs about the importance of being able to predict and control events in their lives 
face an inherently challenging cognitive task when the traumatic event strongly contradicts these beliefs.

It's a more empowering and accurate way to think about what happened. You're acknowledging that you were a victim of a crime, and that it's not your fault. This can help to reduce feelings of guilt and shame. Would you like to continue exploring ways to challenge and reframe other negative thoughts and feelings related to the trauma?

Embarking on Treatment 45 
Similarly, a strong therapeutic relationship helps you to create a setting that is con- ducive to learning 
safety during exposure. For example, Julia was very reluctant to complete exposure. Her therapist 
encouraged Julia to proceed by gently saying, ªTell me exactly what happened.º Later, while processing 
her brief thought that the therapist was ªmean,º Julia also noted, ªAlthough I thought you were being

really did not care about her. Her therapist continued: ªI obviously really upset you, and I can really 
understand why you would feel that way and think that I don't careº (i.e., communicating that Amy's 
response is understandable). Amy's thera- pist did not initially challenge Amy's interpretation by saying 
that she did care. Rather, she validated Amy's perspective, until it became clear that Amy had registered 
the val- idation. At that point, Amy noted that she could think of some reasons why her thera- pist might 
have legitimate reasons for being late, and that the phone call probably meant that her therapist did care. 
Amy then agreed to reschedule; subsequently, when her therapist was a bit late, Amy did not flee the 
waiting room. 
ADDRESSING YOUR OWN ISSUES 
A number of therapist factors may influence treatment. For example, if you fear that trauma-focused 
treatment will ªretraumatizeº your patients, you will be unlikely to use this approach. PTSD experts also

exposure, as long as safety precautions were taken. For example, Steve agreed to give the revolvers to a
friend for 1 week, though he was unwilling to give them up longer. His psychiatrist also made sure she 
was avail- able to admit Steve to the hospital if his suicidality escalated. During the first exposure session,
Steve's experienced therapist felt significant anxiety and urges to avoid using exposure. 
Steve benefited tremendously from his first exposure session, and subsequent ses- sions were much less
anxiety provoking for the therapist. This example, however, high- lights the reality that exposure may 
require you to confront your own anxiety. Exposure also may require you to tolerate other negative 
emotions that can be triggered by par- ticularly horrific events. For example, in listening to Kelly describe 
an exceedingly bru- tal gang rape in detail, her therapist experienced horror and profound sadness. The

she was obligated to take care of her father in old age. As a result, Gloria decreased contact with her 
father, and her urges to cut also rapidly declined. Similarly, Nihla, who was sexually abused by her 
cousin, continued to have regular contact with him at family functions and via telephone, even though he 
was often subtly sexually suggestive during these encounters. These contacts fueled Nihla's an- ger, so 
her therapist began by addressing Nihla's thoughts that she was obligated to maintain a relationship with 
her cousin. Subsequent interventions also targeted an- ger. 
Finally, the decision to introduce cognitive restructuring first also relates to practi- cal issues of timing. If 
you are beginning treatment with a new patient right before you leave for vacation, then this might not be 
a good time to start exposure. Thus, you might decide to introduce cognitive restructuring during the few
