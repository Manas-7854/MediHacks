It sounds like you may be experiencing depressive symptoms and using alcohol as a coping mechanism, Manas. It's important to address both the depression and the alcohol use. Have you considered seeking professional help, such as a mental health counselor or a support group, to address these issues? They can provide you with the support and guidance you need to make positive changes in your life.

Also, it's important to find healthy coping mechanisms to deal with stressors and negative emotions, instead of turning to alcohol. Some examples include exercise, mindfulness, reaching out to a trusted friend or family member, or engaging in a hobby.

Thank you for sharing this information, Manas. It sounds like you are experiencing both physical and emotional symptoms related to your alcohol use and depression.

Drinking alcohol 4-5 nights a week can have a significant impact on your physical health, including increased risk of liver damage, heart disease, and other health issues. Additionally, alcohol is a depressant, so it can exacerbate symptoms of depression and make it harder to manage.

It's important to find healthy coping mechanisms to deal with negative emotions, such as feeling sad or disappointed in yourself. Some examples include exercise, mindfulness, reaching out to a trusted friend or family member, or engaging in a hobby.

It's also important to set goals for reduction of alcohol consumption, track it, and find ways to resist triggers.

Regarding depression, it's important to address both the depression and the alcohol use. Depression is a serious condition that can benefit from professional treatment. I would recommend considering seeking professional help, such as a mental health counselor or a support group, to address these issues. They can provide you with the support and guidance you need to make positive changes in your life.

It's also important to remember that recovery is a journey with ups and downs, and it's important not to be too hard on yourself.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Also, I would like to remind you that seeking help is a sign of strength, and it's never too late to start making positive changes. I am here to support you in any way I can.
